# GoSearchSuggestions

Hello! This is a project I started to learn Go. It's basically a port of an old assignment from C# to Go!

I hope to have a front end with query suggestions on every key press. For testing purposes I have commited the title.txt file which is must smaller than the wiki titles I will use in the completed assignment.
